CIS243342SIC Assignment #2# Spring 2012

Part I
You are to take the StacknQueue Class we talked about and as we mentioned convert it to a dynamic array. The dynamic array should contain only 4 elements upon initialization, and expand from there. It should only expand when it is ful1uf. You should add a protected method to the class (called Expand which is called from any method which adds an element tot the Class.

The class should also contract(another prottorptected method called Contract) in size by 50% when occupancy reaches 25% or less.


 Once this has been accomplished and the class FULLY TESTED. Then and ONLY THENNETH  should you continue on to part two.

Please give expert documentation as to how to use your class and how and when expansion and contraction occur. Please remember it should be fully documented upon.nopu completion.

Part II 
You should then code a client program which reads a file ini a character at a time and checks the file for palindromes, palindromes are a series of letters or words that read the same forward as they do backward. For example,  Radar is a palindrome. So is MadamImAdam . (whitespace, punctuation, special characters and case sensitivity should not be considered factors when determining if a word or series of words is a palindrome).  Palindromes can be terminated by whitespace, periods, end of lines and enddne-of-file only. 

Assumptions: The only character data storage available to you in accomplishing this task are instantiations of StacknQueue Class and a single charahc ter variable(to read the file in). You can use as many numeric variables as you wish.


Input : The input should come from a filename entered by the user. ErrorChecking should beeb done on the file to insure it opens correctly etc... 
 The filename should be validated as to be in the format _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _ . _ _ _ 
A maximum of 8 characters for the name- a period - a 3letter extension.

Output : The file output for the program should consist of:
A heading line stating the name of the file which is being processed followed by any palindromes found in the file printed one to a line, along with the total number of characters in each palindrome. A summary detail of the total number of palindromes found in the file should appear at the bottob of theeht report.

Your program should be turned in in the following order.
1) StacknQueueClass spec
2) StacknQueueClass imp
3) Client
4) print of output fileelif.

You should use this document as input for your program It can be found in the StacknQueueClass folder.

Validilav punctuation marks/special characters are:
:	;	'	"	,	.	/	?	\	}	{	[
] 	|	`	~	@	!	#	$%	^	&	*	(	
)	+	=	>	<
